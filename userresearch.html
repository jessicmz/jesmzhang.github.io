				<h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
				<a href="images/research/133 mockup - Copy.pdf"><img class="improved" src ="images/improved.PNG"></a>

				<p> I learned that first impressions and how your website initially impacts the user is important; web users want instant gratification and 
				if a website does not meet their expectations, they simply move on. I realized this fact when I was looking through competitor websites: 
				I was less likely to browse portfolios that did not catch my attention right away, and I was more likely to browse the content of someone with unique imagery or bold typography. 
				</p>
				<p>During user interviews, I found that the feature that sets apart a personal website and a professional networking site such as LinkedIn is personality.
				The two students I interviewed both liked the idea of having a portfolio website; they felt that a personal portfolio is different from a professional networking
				site because portfolios allow site owners to be creative and express their personality, whereas networking sites such as LinkedIn have a specific structure and is less flexible.
				</p>
				<p>The biggest benefit of usability testing was identifying problems users might encounter with my site. The click test revealed that users scan a website,
				thus visual hierarchy is important. When I asked users where to click to connect with me via LinkedIn, users missed the LinkedIn logo and clicked towards
				the bottom of the page. When asked why, they revealed that they thought scrolling would reveal contact information, instead of looking at all the elements on the screen. 
				When introducing improvements to my website, I want to include more white space to free up cognitive load and provide clear, intuitive navigation so users can quickly
				scan my website for information they want. </p>

			<header class="major">
				<h3>Incorportation of Findings</h3>
				<p>From the feedback of users who took the usability test, most of the comments were stating that my layout seems too simple or out dated. 
				I changed the layout of the site to the trending grid based design to make my content more organized, introduce more white space, and provide visual hierarchy to 
				highlight the most important elements on the screen. My revised home page will introduce icons that reflect the navigation menu; when users hover their 
				mouse over the navigation link, the corresponding icon will become highlighted. More white space also improves my site’s visual hierarch; users are directed to 
				the most important elements on the page. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I have included a link to the wireframes I created to conduct my cognitive walkthrough. I also included an image of the home page,
				which I am currently working on. I am planning on using bootstrap to structure my content into a grid system. The challenges I have encountered
				with using bootstrap is overloading bootstrap CSS; removing the hamburger menu can be difficult because it is built into bootstrap’s components.  
				</p>
				<p>
				Since my site is specific to a portfolio, with few navigation links, I removed the left panel, which was 
				originally going to contain the navigation links, and changed it for the horizontal navigation bar at the top of the screen; 
				with all the links at the top of the page, the user can find what they want faster and easier. For the cognitive walkthrough, 
				I created an improved wireframe version of my site. The result was that users liked the idea of having all the links visible rather 
				than collapsed. Further research showed that users are less likely to use navigation when navigation links are hidden, thus I removed the controversial hamburger menu. 
				I learned that as a designer, I should put users before trends: just because a feature is trending does not necessarily mean better usability.

				<h3>Feature Analysis</h3>
					<p>The goal of analyzing my competitors is to find their strengths and weakness. The strengths of my competitor sites featured simplistic layouts with either bold typography or interesting interactions such as hover image transitions or image sliders. The simple layout paired with exciting interactions catches the user’s attention and directs the user to what the author wants the user to see first. The best web portfolio was one that had a navigation style that accommodated for each page’s different situation.

				<h3>User Interviews</h3>
					<p>User interviews are important because it can tell us the user’s expectations and concerns. Then as a designer, I can design features that address their expectations and concerns. The questions I asked addressed expectations such as what the user would expect from viewing a web portfolio, any concerns in using one, and features that add value.

				<h3>Feature Matrix</h3>
					<p>The feature value matrix helped me identify the priority, success rate, and customer need all in one table. I identified that the highest user value features are contact methods via social media, grid layout, responsive design, and interaction cues such as hover animations. One feature with a high business value is allowing users to add comments to the authors personal blog. Blogs help drive traffic to the author's website, promote yourself as a leader, and develop good relationship with your users. Blogs that are not related to work topic is a good way for users to know you personally and professionally.</p>

					<h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
					<p>The Kano model helped me visualize which features were most important in my competitor’s personal portfolio. The model showed that responsive design, grid layout, and interactive links yielded high business value, while methods of contacting via email or social media were high in business value, but low in user value. As a designer, I want to create something a user wants to use, and the increased traffic provides business value. </p>

				<h3>User Stories</h3>
				
					<p>User stories are important because it shifts the focus from writing about features to discussing features. User stories is another way to describe requirements of your product. I identified two major users that would use a portfolio: a hiring manager, and a peer. A hiring manager’s purpose is to learn more about the candidate to see if they have the capabilities to do the work. A peer, such as a colleague or someone in the same work field would view the portfolio as a way to assess their own skills, or see what skills are marketable to potential employers. </p>

				<article class="blog">
				<h3>Cognitive Walkthroughs</h3>
					<p>Cognitive Walkthroughs are important because the designer can use it to determine whether a new user can carry out the specific task within a given system. I ask the user to complete a series of tasks and then evaluate whether the goal was achieved, if the actions available were obvious, and if the user got feedback that their action is correct.  Results of the walkthrough showed that users preferred visible navigation menu, rather than the collapsed hamburger menu. The only challenge that I faced was that asking the user four questions after each step of the task was tedious. </p>

				<h3>User Testing</h3>
				<p>I conducted two tests: the click test and the question test. A click test allows the designer to see the effectiveness of the structure of my site, such as navigation. The click test showed that not all users know what social media icons look like; a possible solution would be to include labels next to the icons. The question test’s purpose was to get an understanding of what elements appealed to the user the most and the least. Results of the question test showed that users felt that the layout was too simple because there were not any meaningful or interesting interactions.  </p>
