					<h3>I also love art</h3>
					<p>I was an aspiring artist as a kid. I tried a large variety of art styles and 
					mediums ranging from oil, arcylic, charcoal, watercolor, graphite, and pastels. 
					I mainly sketch black and white portraits and paint colored landscapes. I am
					more of a traditional artist, but I also appreciate select abstract pieces.</p>

					<h3>I love food </h3>
					<p>Anyone that knows me know I love to eat. I also love cooking, it is therapeutic for me. I like to
					know what I am eating, and the best way to know that you are putting good things into your body
					is to prepare it yourself. I also love baking and decorating sweets such as cakes, macaroons, and cookies.</p>

					<h3>I love to play badminton </h3>
					<p>I played competively in high school and participated in tournaments. I am also part
					of the badminton club here at UCI. Not only is it a great way to keep myself in shape,
					it is also a way for me to destress and take my mind off of school.</p>
